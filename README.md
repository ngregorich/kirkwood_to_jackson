This repository contains a [Juypter Notebook](downhill_analysis.ipynb) used to analyze [csv data](Tesla-2024-03-10&#32;13-34-28-2024-03-10&#32;14-25-11.csv) from a trip in a Tesla Model Y

This trip was particularly interesting because it was almost entirely downhill from Kirkwood in Lake Tahoe, to Jackson, California. This 45 mile journey required just 1.5 kWh, the other energy coming from regenerative braking and gravity
